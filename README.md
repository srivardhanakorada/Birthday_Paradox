# Birthday Paradox


Given that there are 365 days in a year, one might think in a group of about 25 people there will be very less chance of two person's birthday falling on the same day. But the following graph shows that clashing of birthdays within a group of people is more often than one might think. It is about 0.5 for group of 23 people. This is a well known vertical paradox in mathematics.
